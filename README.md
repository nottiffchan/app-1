# vibing.
A web app created for Hack&Roll 2021, an annual 24-hour hackathon organised by NUS Hackers.

## Inspiration
We are a group of friends that enjoy listening to music, and we like to share our new discoveries with one another. However, this doesn't always end well because we have different tastes. During a road trip with a friend, we we were arguing over what music to play. Then it hit us. How good would it be, to have an app that uses the songs each of us likes to automatically generate a playlist which would contain songs we all like?

## What it does
vibing. allows you to log in and authenticate with Spotify. From there, you can enter some songs you and your friend are vibing with at the moment, and that's it! You will be served a piping hot and spicy playlist of songs you would all like (algorithmically speaking)!

## How it's built
vibing. is built using the Angular framework as well as NodeJS (express) for the server side to fetch data from Spotify API. It is hosted on Heroku.

## What's next
Using Flask to create a more specific algorithm to serve even sPiCiEr playlists!
